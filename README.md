# Startredirect

Allows Startpage Anonymous View users to insert any URL which lets them visit any website under Startpage Anonymous View. This is useful for URLs that don't appear in Startpage's search results when searching, making them inaccessible unless a website that can be visited via Anonymous View has the other aforementioned website linked in some way.

Think of Startredirect as a universal solution of that.

# Important Message From Creator

This was just a small utility I made because I was bored and considered the idea nifty when it randomly came to my mind. This means I'm not going to work much (or at all) on it since it serves its functionality which is my only necessity. Feel free to fork this project and conduct whichever improvements; this project is licensed under The Unlicense which essentially means anyone can do whatever they so choose with my code.
